# Error Fix - Missing Import

## Error Message
```
WARN  [Layout children]: No route named "index" exists in nested children: ["events", "settings"]
```

## Root Cause
The error was actually a **red herring**. The real issue was a **missing import** in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`.

The `borderRadius` constant was being used in the styles but wasn't imported from the theme.

## Fix Applied

**File**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
import { colors, typography, spacing } from '../../theme';
```

**After**:
```typescript
import { colors, typography, spacing, borderRadius } from '../../theme';
```

## Why This Caused the Error

When a component has a runtime error (like a missing constant), React Native can fail to render it properly, which causes Expo Router to think the route doesn't exist. The warning message was misleading - the file existed, but it couldn't render due to the missing import.

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - The app should now load correctly!
